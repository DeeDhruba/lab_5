        Giant sequoia groves are portions of Sierra Nevada mixed conifer forest that contain giant sequoias. In most groves, giant sequoias are fewer in number than other tree species, but are the most visually striking and dominant in size. Giant sequoias grow only on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada in California, between 4,000 and 8,000 feet (1219 and 2438 m) in elevation. Within park boundaries, park staff distinguish approximately 40 different giant sequoia groves, ranging from one to tens of thousands of sequoia trees per grove.

    <h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The communities offer many activities for guided visits that allow visitors to enjoy Sequoia National Park natural beauty. More than 1 million visitors travel to Sequoia National Park every year to see the magnificent and majestic trees. Simply driving through the park is awe-inspiring, but to truly experience its unforgettable sights, you'll need to get out of your car, either to stand next to one of the trees in the Giant Forest, hike to a scenic overlook or explore an underground cave.</p>
